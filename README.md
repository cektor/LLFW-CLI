# LLFW-CLI
 LLFW (Low-Level Formatter Wizard) is a command line tool that facilitates low-level formatting operations for disks. It supports disk selection, data sanitization methods (zero-fill, random data, secure erase) and FAT32 formatting. It requires root privileges and warns that all data will be deleted.
